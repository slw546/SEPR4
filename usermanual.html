				<h4>Objective</h4>
				<p>The primary objective of Bear Traffic Control is to earn the maximum amount of money possible by instructing planes so as they travel safely through the airspace, along their intended path between point of origin and destination.</p>
				<p>To win the game, regardless of money earned, you must successfully guide all planes around the airspace, between its the defined origin/destination points of the plane</p>
				
				<h4>Money</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Each plane starts off with a value of 100 Rubles (R100).</li>
					<li>Poor/careless manoeuvring of planes will result in deductions from a plane’s value:</li>
					<ul>
				    	<li>A deduction of between R10-R1 for separation violations.</li>
				    	<li>A deduction of R2 or R1 for each time the flight plan is altered (i.e., the path changed to use different waypoints).</li>
				    </ul>
				    <li>The value of a plane is banked upon it successfully leaving the airspace (having visited the airport if necessary).</li>
				    <ul>
				    	<li>Banking is where the value of a plane is added to the total, cumulative score/amount earned.</li>
				    </ul>
				</ul>
				<p>Money can be exchanged for goods and services. A variety of goods are available to purchase in the in-game shop.</p>
				
				<h4>Flights</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Each plane will originate from one of the four corners of the map, Moscow, Khorlovo, Peski, or Malino (Clockwise from top-right/North-West, 1.d/2.d).</li>
					<ul>
						<li>These four points also act as destinations, along with Chkalovsky Airport (1.h).</li>
					</ul>
					<li>The plane will automatically be given a destination (2.e) and a flightpath (1.j.IV) via any assortment of waypoints (1.f) to travel via to reach that destination.</li>
					<li>The flight will automatically fly along the flightpath, taking the straightest, most direct route permitted by its turn radius, unless the user intervenes.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Altitude (1.j.III, 2.b, 3) will remain fixed unless altered by the player.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>The destination will be one of two categories:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>One of the origin points, in which case the plane will depart the airspace having reached such point (completed flight).</li>
						<li>A landing point (1.g), a point that must be passed, in order the plane can subsequently land at the airport (1.h).</li>
						<ul>
							<li>In order for a plane to land having passed the landing point, the player must instruct it to do so (i.e., a plane will not land automatically).</li>
							<li>The plane will circle its assigned landing point until the player clears it to land.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<li>If the destination is a landing point, upon reaching the terminal and parking (1.i), the player must then clear the aircraft to take off.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Upon take off, the plane will be given a new destination and flightpath (and value).</li>
						<li>Having taken off, it will then behave as any plane with a destination from (1.d), designated automatically and listed at (2.d).</li>
					</ul>
